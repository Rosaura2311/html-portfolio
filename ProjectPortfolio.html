<h2>Movie Ranking Project</h2>
<p>In this project we ranked all of my top favourite movies in order from most to least favourite. 
1 - The Best, and the the last number the furthest away from "the best", but they still are my favourite movies.
We also decided to put different genres, to make it diverese.
